First post on my first blog. Here begins an adventure that I had been wanting to start for a long time (years).

## Who am I?

Since 2018 I have been **teaching Physics and Chemistry** at [IES Ría San Martín de Cantabria](http://portaleducativo.educantabria.es/web/iesriasanmartin) (Spain). My previous experience includes mainly **research** and **teaching** at the [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx), in particular in the branch of ***Physical Optics***. You can **learn more about me** [**here**]({{< ref"/sobre-mi" >}}).


## Why this blog?

My main intention with this website is to provide 📚 [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">**Physics and Chemistry notes**</span>]({{< ref "/apuntes" >}}) and 🎓 [<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">**EBAU resources**</en>]({{< ref "/recursos-ebau" >}})[^1] to my students and to anyone else who might be interested, as well as sharing 👐 [<en style="font-variant: small-caps;">**tutorials**</english>]({{< ref "/tutoriales" >}}) and collect 🔗 [<english style="font-variant:small-caps;">**interesting links**</english>]({{< ref "/enlaces-interes" >}}).
	
[^1]: Thanks to the [excellent compilation](http://elfisicoloco.blogspot.com/p/pau-cantabria-new.html) of [**EL FÍSICO LOCO**](http://elfisicoloco.blogspot.com) and the magnificent work of **Professor Enrique Ortega González** of IES José del Campo of Ampuero.

I think that a **blog** is the perfect addition to be able to debate about **news** with a much more **dynamic** content.

## What am I going to talk about on this blog?
In this blog you will find **opinion** articles, **curiosities** about **science** in general and posts related to my **interests**, which include, among others:

- ✈️ Travel
- 🎸 Music
- 🎮 Video games

## Who is this blog for?

The posts in this blog are aimed at my students and anyone else who is curious about science and/or shares any of my interests.

## How can you get involved?

In all the blog posts as well as in the 📚 [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">**notes**</span>]({{< ref "/apuntes" >}}) you can *give* me 👏 ***kudos***[^2], share on your favorite social networks or subscribe to the RSS feed {{< icon name="rss" pack="fas" >}} so you don't miss any updates. Also, you can write me either using the [contact form]({{< ref "/#contacto" >}}), or by writing me directly an [email](mailto:rodri.alcaraz@gmail.com) or from [{{< icon name="twitter" pack="fab" >}} Twitter](https://twitter.com/alcarazr). You can also follow me on [{{< icon name="instagram-square" pack="fab" >}} Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fisiquimicamente/).

[^2]: There are *likes* and then there are *kudos*. This word, from the Greek κῦδος, means *fame*, *glory* or *prestige*. By giving me kudos you are acknowledging and praising my effort, encouraging me to continue preparing quality materials.

I hope you enjoy this space and that it's useful to you. Feel free to join in whenever you like. We are in touch, my friend.
