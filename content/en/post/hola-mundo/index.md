First post on my first blog. Here begins an adventure that I had been wanting to start for a long time (years).

## Who am I?

Since 2018 I have been **teaching Physics and Chemistry** at [IES Ría San Martín de Cantabria](http://portaleducativo.educantabria.es/web/iesriasanmartin) (Spain). My previous experience includes mainly **research** and **teaching** at the [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx), in particular in the branch of ***Physical Optics***. You can **learn more about me** [**here**]({{< ref"/sobre-mi" >}}).


## Why this blog?

My main intention with this website is to provide 📚 [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">**Physics and Chemistry notes**</span>]({{< ref "/apuntes" >}}) to my students and to anyone else who might be interested, as well as sharing 👐🏼 [<en style="font-variant: small-caps;">**tutorials**</english>]({{< ref "/tutoriales" >}}) and collect 🔗 [<english style="font-variant:small-caps;">**online resources**</english>]({{< ref "/recursos-online" >}}).

I think that a **blog** is the perfect addition to be able to debate about **news** with a much more **dynamic** content.

## What am I going to talk about on this blog?
In this blog you will find **opinion** articles, **curiosities** about **science** in general and posts related to my **interests**, which include, among others:

- ✈️ Travel
- 🎸 Music
- 🎮 Video games
- ⚛️ *Photons*

## Who is this blog for?

The posts in this blog are aimed at my students and anyone else who is curious about science and/or shares any of my interests.

## How can you get involved?
