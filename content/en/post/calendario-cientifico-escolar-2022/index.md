For the third consecutive year, the [Instituto de Ganadería de Montaña (IGM)](http://www.igm.ule-csic.es), a joint centre of the [Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC)](https://www.csic.es/en) and the [Universidad de León](https://www.unileon.es), is promoting this project, which aims to bring scientific culture closer to the younger population and offer close, diverse and current references to science.

The ***Scientific School Calendar 2022*** is mainly aimed at primary and secondary school students. Each day features a **scientific or technological anniversary**, such as, for example, the births of people in these fields or the commemoration of outstanding discoveries.

In addition, the calendar is accompanied by a [**didactic guide**](https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/256430/3/2022-ENG-Scientific-school-calendar-didactic-guide.pdf) with guidelines for its transversal educational use in the classroom, including activities adapted to each age range and to students with special needs.
